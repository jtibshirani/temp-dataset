def broadcast_to(array, shape, subok=False):
    """Broadcast an array to a new shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : array_like
        The array to broadcast.
    shape : tuple
        The shape of the desired array.
    subok : bool, optional
        If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise
        the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array (default).

    Returns
    -------
    broadcast : array
        A readonly view on the original array with the given shape. It is
        typically not contiguous. Furthermore, more than one element of a
        broadcasted array may refer to a single memory location.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the array is not compatible with the new shape according to NumPy's
        broadcasting rules.

    Examples

    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> np.broadcast_to(x, (3, 3))

           [1, 2, 3],
           [1, 2, 3]])
